- No default arguments for functions in java. We have to use method overloading or builder pattern. Or may be pass a map with list of all parameter values.
- Integer.parseInt(str) returns a primitive int whereas Integer.valueof(str) returns a new instance of Integer. Otherwise they are the same
- A return statement in a finally block always trumps any other return statements in try blocks . SO this is a very dangerous practice.
- Finally will always execute except: 1. If you invoke system.exit()  
									  2. If the JVM crashes first;
									  3. If the JVM reaches an infinite loop (or some other non-interruptable, non-terminating statement) in the try or catch block;
									  4. If the OS forcibly terminates the JVM process; e.g. "kill -9 " on UNIX.
									  5. If the host system dies; e.g. power failure, hardware error, OS panic, etcetera.
- Autoboxing : conversion from primitive types to object wrapper classes like Integer/Long.
- java caches values from -127 to 127 in the same reference. So when we compare two numbers that are in this range, we will always get true becuase it references to the same object.
ie  Integer a = 127; Integer b = 127; a==b ? true;
	Integer a = 128; Integer b = 128; a==b ? false;
	Integer a = 127; Integer b = 127; a.equals(b) ? true;
	
- How to make class immutable (or Given a class, how to make sure other developers don't change it)
https://howtodoinjava.com/core-java/basics/how-to-make-a-java-class-immutable/
  - Make private constructor and use factory methods to generate new instances of the given class
  - Make all variables private and final
  - dont provide setters
  - make class final so that subclasses cannot override
  - Perform cloning of objects in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference.

- Does wait() method have to be called from synchronized method or block? Why?
Yes, Using synchronized makes a method / block accessible by only on thread at a time. So, yes, it's thread-safe.
The two concepts are combined, not mutually-exclusive. When you use wait() you need to own the monitor on that object. 
So you need to have synchronized(..) on it before that. Using .wait() makes the current thread stop until another thread calls .notify() on the object it waits on. 
This is an addition to synchronized, which just ensures that only one thread will enter a block/method.
