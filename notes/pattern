Peak Element: Binary search - We start off by finding the middle element, mid from the given numsnums array. 
If this element happens to be lying in a descending sequence of numbers. or a local falling slope(found by comparing nums[i]
to its right neighbour), it means that the peak will always lie towards the left of this element.
